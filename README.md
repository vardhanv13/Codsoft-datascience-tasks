  ## Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. Using machine learning algorithms, I analyzed the data to provide insights and predictions.

### Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Iris Flower Classification

This project focuses on classifying different species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is a classic in the machine learning community and is used for demonstrating classification algorithms.

### Key Features
- Data visualization and EDA
- Implementation of various classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc.
- Performance evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report

### Dataset
The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset).

## Sales Prediction

In this project, I built a predictive model to forecast sales based on historical data. The goal was to analyze trends and provide actionable insights for inventory management and marketing strategies.

### Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- Model implementation using Linear Regression and other techniques
- Visualization of sales trends and predictions

### Dataset
The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input).

## Technologies Used
